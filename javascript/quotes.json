She's a great wonderful charming lady, her photos shows the inside and the personality of any artist she worked with, so for me she's the Helmut Newton of Festival Night & club-culture! In her photos you can feel the magic and mystery of this secret Dark World! Love Hell"

She not only captures the mood of what exactly is going on but brings her own aesthetic to those moments, she frames nightlife like no-one else, and captures a moment in time for everyone to see!"

		"quote": "I first became aware of Marinaâ€™s work when she photographed one of my all time favourite DJs, Andy Weatherall, and captured the essence of an artist I loved in a very special way. I liked it so much that I purchased one of her prints from her exhibition, and its hung in my lounge. Her range of shots with many of the stars of electronic music made her the perfect choice for an exhibition in our office. I am extremely happy with the results. Looking through her portfolio the shots that move me the most are those she has taken with the DJ looking into a mirror backstage. She manages to reflect the aura of the DJ to the viewer- a very special skill. This led me to ask if she would be interested in sharing her pictures of some of the worlds most talented DJs with Beatport for our office in Berlin. There were more great shots than we could hope to fit in the office but we picked a nice split of DJs from all over the world."
