		<h3>About Marina</h3>
		<p>My name is Marina, a girl full of contradictions : born in Marseilles, the city of French hip hop, the week when Saturday Night Fever was released, I love a good pogo brawl at rock concerts. I've
		been living in Paris since 2001, and I've been clubbing for 25 years.</p>
		<p>After my first music blog musicbymarina.fr was created in 2011, I started following djs, producers and rock bands throughout Europe with my camera.
		My first cam was a Sony compact in 2012, then came shortly my current Nikon reflex camera, plain, without using any extra features such as flash, lightings, nor image editing softwares. I just press the shutter button in order to not denature my own vision.</p>
		<p>I was lucky to catch the eye of some cool people and since then I have been commissioned photo reports and portraits backstage by various magazines and musical labels. </p>
		<p>I try to not stage my photos, except for some mirror portraits backstage : the reflection of the musicians reveals their personnality : those who live with their narcissism, those who play with it, and those who have trouble taking a look in the mirror.</p>
		<p>I like to transpose in my pictures the emotional link between the musician and his audience, and be on stage so that my photos show faithfully what the musician feels when I press the shutter button.</p>
